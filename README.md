Bosch BME280 (Temperture/Pressure/Humidity Sensor) C Library for Microchip 16bit Processors

This Library is based on the Adafruit Open Source Library for Arduino Processors. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library

This Libary supports I2C Only.

I have included the IC2 and Serial Driver for the PIC24F128GA204 Processor

I have also included an example Project that displays Temperture, Pressure and Humidity on to the serial port of the processor @ 19200bps
